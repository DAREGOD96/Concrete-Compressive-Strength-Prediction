## Problem Statement

The quality of concrete is determined by its compressive strength, which is measured
using a conventional crushing test on a concrete cylinder. The strength of the concrete
is also a vital aspect in achieving the requisite longevity. It will take 28 days to test
strength, which is a long period. So, what will we do now? We can save a lot of time and
effort by using Data Science to estimate how much quantity of which raw material we
need for acceptable compressive strength.
